The scope of unlicensed use percentage is calculated based on the total number of licenses purchased compared to actual install base of the Software.  \
By exercising the rights and procedures described above, Phase One does not waive its rights to enforce this License or to protect its intellectual property by any other means permitted by law including without limitation to claim compensation for past unlicensed use of the Software.\
Any failure in whole or in part to comply with the obligations set out in this sec. 12 shall constitute a material breach by you which entails Phase One to terminate this License for material breach by you.\
